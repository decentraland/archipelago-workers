# Archipelago Service

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/decentraland/archipelago-workers/badge.svg?branch=coverage)](https://coveralls.io/github/decentraland/archipelago-workers?branch=coverage)

The Archipelago worker is a bundle of services designed to support a standalone realm in Decentraland. It consists of a `core` service that implements the established clustering logic to group users into islands based on their in-world positions. Additionally, the `ws-connector` service provides a WebSocket connection, exposed to Decentraland clients through the [Realm Provider](https://github.com/decentraland/realm-provider/). A `stats` service is also included, aggregating information about islands and peers, making it available for consumption.
